## Introduction

This project explores **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**, two fundamental techniques in machine learning and data analysis. 

- **Linear Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
  
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression predicts discrete values (such as 0 or 1) and uses a sigmoid function to model the probability of an event.

## Dataset Description

### Dataset 1: Iris Dataset
- **Type**: Continuous (can be used for both classification and regression tasks)
- **Features**: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
- **Target Variable**: Primarily used to classify iris species into three categories: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. However, for regression purposes, we can predict **Sepal Length** or **Petal Length** based on the other features.
- **Description**: While primarily used for classification tasks, the Iris dataset can also be adapted for linear regression, particularly for predicting continuous values like Sepal Length or Petal Length. It is a well-known dataset in machine learning due to its simplicity and versatility.

### Dataset 2: Mushroom Classification Dataset
- **Type**: Binary classification.
- **Features**: Describes several physical characteristics of mushrooms such as cap shape, cap color, gill size, and odor.
- **Target Variable**: The task is to predict whether a mushroom is **poisonous** or **edible**.
- **Description**: This dataset contains detailed information about mushrooms and their physical features. It's a classic dataset for binary classification tasks and is often used to test the performance of machine learning models like logistic regression. 

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are:
1. To apply **Linear Regression** on the **Iris dataset** to predict Sepal Length or Petal Length based on other attributes and evaluate model performance.
2. To use **Logistic Regression** on the **Mushroom Classification dataset** to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible, and assess the accuracy of the model.
3. To understand the underlying assumptions of both models and compare their use cases.
4. To visualize data insights and model performance through graphs and metrics like R-squared, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
