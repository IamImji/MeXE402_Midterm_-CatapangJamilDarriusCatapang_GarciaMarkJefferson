## Introduction

This paper highlights the basics of two such techniques known as **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**. These are two of the most critical techniques in machine learning and data analysis.

- **Linear Regression**: This is a supervised learning algorithm that makes predictions on continuous output based on one or multiple input variables. It assumes a linear relationship between input features and target outputs.

- **Logistic Regression**: one class of algorithms where the outcomes will depict how likely it is that something might happen or not. Logistic regression does differ with linear regression since, instead of predicting a value, it predicts discrete values like 0 or 1, and it uses the sigmoid function to approximate an event's probability.

## Dataset Description

### Dataset 1: Iris Dataset
- **Type**: Continous (both classification and regression tasks are allowed)
- **Features**: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
- **Target Variable**: The iris species are mainly classified into three types. Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. But in case of regression, we can predict the value for **Sepal Length** or **Petal Length** based on other attributes.
- **Description**: The Iris dataset may be used for classification tasks. However, it is very easily adapted to the linear regression where a continuous value like Sepal Length or Petal Length could be predicted. It's one of the most famous datasets in machine learning for its simplicity and flexibility.

### Dataset 2: Mushroom Classification Dataset
- **Type**: Binary classification.
- **Features**: Describes different physical characteristics of mushrooms such as its cap shape, cap color, gill measurement, and scent.
- **Target Variable**: To classify whether a mushroom is **poisonous** or **edible**.
- **Description**: This dataset is a detailed description of mushrooms along with physical features. It serves as a classic example for binary classification tasks and often comes up in testing models like logistic regression.

## Project Objectives

The goals of this project are:

1. Apply **Linear Regression** on **Iris dataset** to predict Sepal Length or Petal Length based on other attributes and assess the performance of models.
3. Employ the **Mushroom Classification dataset** to apply **Logistic Regression** towards predicting whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible, along with its model accuracy.
4. To understand the tacit assumptions of both models and compare usage in applications.
5. To make interactive data insights, model performance through graphs and metrics including R-squared, precision, recall, and ROC (Receiver-Operating Characteristic) curve.
